## About Me

I'm <b>Kedar Waychal</b> (केदार वायचळ), a new PhD Student with Dr <b>Ilan Lampl</b> at the Department of Brain Sciences. We broadly work on decision-making involving the somatosensory system. I'm still figuring out where I fit in this!

I'm from Navi Mumbai, India. I completed my Bachelor's + Master's in Chemistry, with my Master's thesis being a biochemistry project involving the synthesis of a molecule intended to act as a fluorescent probe for mitochondrial DNA G-quadruplexes in cells.

This is not my work, I for sure did not get images as pretty as these* |

When I'm not working, I spend my time practicing the *bansuri*, playing gacha games like *Arknights* and *Reverse:1999*, and bingeing manga.

## Programming stuff

Here is the [repository](https://github.com/waychalkedar/python-course-assignments) for assignments as a part of the course.

I have also made a [repository for a course](https://github.com/waychalkedar/mm722-iitb) during my undergraduate containing a few of the Jupyter notebooks I used in the course to process and generate plots from data.

## Contact

You can reach out to me on my [Weizmann email](kedar.waychal@weizmann.ac.il). I'm also present (but not very active) on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/kedarw11037).
