## About Me

I'm Kedar Waychal (केदार वायचळ), a new PhD Student with Dr <b>Ilan Lampl</b> at the Department of Brain Sciences. We broadly work on decision-making involving the somatosensory system. I'm still figuring out where I fit in this!

I'm from Navi Mumbai, India. I completed my Bachelor's + Master's in Chemistry, with my Master's thesis being a biochemistry project involving the synthesis of a molecule intended to act as a fluorescent probe for mitochondrial DNA G-quadruplexes in cells.
